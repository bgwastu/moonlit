# Moonlit
Are you a weirdo who likes to listen to *slowed* or *nightcore* music? Well, you'll probably like this app.

Moonlit is a music app with customizable playback to accompany your moods. It works by using playback rate adjustment and the Web Audio API (for reverb) to manipulate the audio in real-time.

See it in action: [moonlit.wastu.net](https://moonlit.wastu.net)

You can listen to your favorite tracks from multiple platforms on Moonlit:
- **YouTube**: Replace `youtube.com` with `moonlit.wastu.net` to the URL (example: [moonlit.wastu.net/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://moonlit.wastu.net/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ))
- **TikTok**: Replace `tiktok.com` with `moonlit.wastu.net` to the URL (example: [moonlit.wastu.net/@etherealbia/video/7482838437075094790](https://moonlit.wastu.net/@etherealbia/video/7482838437075094790)
