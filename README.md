# Moonlit
Are you a weirdo who likes to listen to *slowed* or *nightcore* music? Well, you'll probably like this app.

Moonlit is a melancholy music app with customizable playback to accompany your moods. It works by using the Web Audio API to manipulate the audio in real-time.

See it in action: [moonlit.wastu.net](https://moonlit.wastu.net)
