# Moonlit
Are you a weirdo who likes to listen to *slowed + reverb* music? Or maybe you like to listen nightcore music? Well, you'll probably like this app.

Moonlit is a melancholy music app with customizable playback and various effects to accompany your moods. It works by using Tone.js (AudioContext API) to manipulate the audio in real-time.

See it in action: [moonlit.wastu.net](https://moonlit.wastu.net)

You can also listen to your favorite tracks from YouTube on Moonlit. Just add `lit` to the URL of any YouTube video (example: [youtube**lit**.com/watch?v=...](https://www.youtubelit.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)).

This project is still in development, so expect bugs and missing features.
